<section id="history">
    <h2>History of Parent Resources EarlyON CFC</h2>
    <p>Parent Resources EarlyON CFC Child and Family Centre has supported East Toronto families since May 1977, when it opened in Regent Park to address the need for early childhood education, parenting support, and community connection. The Centre’s mission was, and still is, to promote healthy child development, improve family well-being, and foster strong community ties through free play-based learning and resources for caregivers.</p>
    <p>In 1996, the Centre relocated to the basement of the United Church at 1117 Gerrard Street East, expanding its services to include workshops, informal counselling, and outreach. The new space helped further the Centre’s goal of reducing isolation, improving self-esteem, and providing a safe environment where children and families could thrive. Over two decades, it became a vital support system, offering parents tools to nurture their children’s development.</p>
    <p>In 2001 Parent Resources EarlyON CFC expanded its satellite services to the Regent Park neighbourhood; then, to St. Lawrence North Market in 2005. Because of the demolishment of the North Market, the satellite site moved to its present place at 173A Front Street in 2010.</p>
    <p>In 2018, when the Main Site on Gerrard’s building was sold to WoodGreen Community Services, Parent Resources EarlyON CFC adapted into a mobile program, continuing to deliver its essential services throughout East Toronto. Even without a permanent home, the Centre remained a key resource for families, providing opportunities for growth, learning, and community engagement.</p>
    <p>By 2022, Parent Resources EarlyON CFC returned to its beautifully renovated space at 1117 Gerrard Street East, now part of a senior residence. Today, the Centre continues its longstanding mission of supporting children, parents, and caregivers by offering a welcoming space to connect, play, and learn, ensuring all families in East Toronto have the resources they need to succeed.</p>
